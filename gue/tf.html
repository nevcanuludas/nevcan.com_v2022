      <h2>Course Outcomes:</h2>
      <p>The GUE Technical Fundamentals course is designed to cultivate the essential skills required for sound technical and cave diving practice. Included among its course outcomes are: to provide the  advanced diver with an opportunity to enhance their diving skills in preparation for entering GUE technical and cave training; to train divers in the theory and practice of nitrox; to provide divers with aspirations for more advanced diver training with the tools that will contribute to a greater  likelihood of success; and to provide non-GUE trained divers with a gateway into GUE technical and cave training.</p>
